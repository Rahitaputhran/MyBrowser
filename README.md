A simple web browser built using PyQt5 and QWebEngineView. The browser includes basic navigation features like Back, Forward, Reload, and Home buttons, along with a URL bar for manual navigation. It loads Google as the default page and YouTube as the home page, both of which can be changed by editing the code. Users can enter a URL in the address bar and press Enter to navigate to the desired website. The browser window is maximized by default for a better user experience.
